= Enhanced Stripes test support for @SpringBean annotated fields =

This extension allows to reuse an existing ApplicationContext within a MockServletContext. 
The StripesInterceptor directly depends on Spring's WebApplicationContext 
instead of just an ApplicationContext. That means that it cannot be replaced 
within unit tests with the unit test's ApplicationContext.

By using this library, this direct dependency is removed by providing a custom 
Stripes implementation for Spring support. It acts as a small adapter which 
allows to reuse an existing SPring ApplicationContext within a mocked 
ServletContext.

= Installation =

Your configuration for production won't change. What changes is the test 
configuration of your test fixture. The source code of stripes-spring-testing 
contains a basic example (ActionBean, SpringBean, Spring config, test fixture) 

First of all, you need a copy of stripes-spring-testing.jar within your test 
classpath. For Maven, just add the following dependency to your pom.xml file:
<pre>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.mcs</groupId>
    <artifactId>stripes-spring-testing</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
</pre>
